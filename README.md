# DAN-NucNet
This project is the implementation of the paper, "DAN-NucNet: A Dual Attention Based Framework for Nuclei Segmentation in Cancer Histology Images Under Wild Clinical Conditions".
There are three main files to test, train and evaluate the code,
* predict.py : it uses the trained model to segment the images. The example images along with the segmented images and the numerical results can be seen in the "Results" folder. We provide the trained model (link can be found in the "Model" folder, named as, "Pre-Trained_DANNucNet"), so that the viewers can reproduce the results. 
* train.py : it is used to train the proposed network.
* test.py : we used test.py to test the proposed network for various types of tissues.

___TNote: Full implementation (missing files) will be publically available upon paper acceptance.___
